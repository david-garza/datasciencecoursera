## Purpose

This is a very unscientific study graphing the coolness of Texas cities as compared to each other. A larger circle indicates that the city is more awesome / cool.

```{r map}
df<-read.csv("data.csv")
m<-leaflet(df)
m<-setView(m,lng = -99.9018,lat = 31.9686, zoom = 5)
m<-addTiles(m)
addCircleMarkers(m,radius = ~coolness/5,label = ~coolness)
```
